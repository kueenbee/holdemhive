	<h2>The Pocket Aces Incentive: : $10 Stipends for Newbies Sponsored by a League Player ...</h2>
	<h3>If You Have Already Played in a League Game (that is, you are a "league player"):</h3>
	<p>If you bring one or more new players to Game 7, the Hive will pay $10 of your buyin and $10 of the buyin of each new player you invite.</p>
	<p></p>
	<h3>If you have not already played a league game (that is, you are a newbie) and would like to play Game 7: </h3>
	<p>Find a league player to invite you and get a $10 stipend toward your buyin! The list of people who have already played at least one game is here:   <a href="https://holdemhive.com/Standings.html"> League Standings</a>  Let me know if you need an email address for a league player!</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>This incentive is first come first serve till the $200 is used up.  The sponsoring player should email me of her/his intent to play and how many newbies you will be bringing along (and who they are)!</p>
	<p></p>
	<p></p>
	<h2>The "Know When To Fold Em" Incentive: Player Bounties!! </h2>
	<p>If all the $200 incentive money is not used to cover the buyin discounts, then the rest of the $200 will go evenly to a bounty for each player!  If we get a lot of newbies the prize pool will be large.  Or, if we don't get a lot of newbies, the bounties will be bigger!  And remember, player-initiated bounties are also allowed!</p>
