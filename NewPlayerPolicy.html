	<p>style="colore red;">For Season 11, the League will pay the game buyin ($30) for the first game a new player plays in the league.  If the new player cashes in her/his first game, she/he will refund the League the $30.</p>
	<p>style="colore red;">New Player's - THIS is the season you've been waiting for to start playing in the league!</p>
	<p>*******</p>
	<h2>New Player Policies</h2>
	<p>As of 7/2025</p>
	<p> Definition: A New Player is anyone who has (1) been phone screened by a Hive host and (2) played less than 3 live games in the league. After playing 3 live games you become a league member!</p>
	<p> League Members are players who (1) have played in 3 or more live games or (2) are an immediate famly member of a league member or (3) are friends or family of the Hive hosts or (4) played in Jim's Poker Table League.</p>
	<p> The Hive will seat only <u><i>one</i></u> New Player per live (@ the Hive) game, on a first-come-first-serve basis. </p>
	<p> To reserve the single "New Player" seat, you must send (Venmo) the Hive your $30 buy-in for the upcoming live game after 6 PM the Sunday before (reservations for future games are not accepted).</p>
	<p> If you are not the first person to reserve the New Player seat, your buy-in will be refunded immediately.</p>
	<p><br></p>
	<p> <u>Refund Policy for Cancellation of "New Player" Seat Reservation</u></p>
        <p> If you don't formally cancel your New Player seat reservation and don't come to the game by the end of the first break, you forfeit your buy-in and will only be allowed to play in a future game if no other New Player wants to play the week you wish to play.</p>
	<p> If you cancel your New Player seat reservation before the day of the tournament you will get an immediate refund.</p>
	<p> If you cancel your New Player seat reservation on the day of the event you will get a refund if and only if </p>
	<p> (1) another new player fills the seat <i>OR</i></p>
	<p> (2) there are no other new players who want to play (assume this will be the case)</p>
	<p> If, due to late cancellation, no interested new player can fill the seat, your non-refunded buy-in will go into the pot for the game in question.</p>
	<p><br></p>
	<p> Note:  New Players who have played at least one live game are welcome to play in any online games (PokerStars) without having to pre-reserve a seat.</p>
	<p>The League reserves the right to make exceptions to this protocol at its sole discretion but will not consider requests to do so.</p>
